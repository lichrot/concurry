# [concurry] Promise & Generator

Inspired by [`motion-canvas`](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas).  
NB: This library is half-baked and not well thought out, don't use in production  
PS: It's just a prank, bro

# [📜] Todo

- Create appropriate interface to allow for different concurrency strategies
- Work out the correct promise handling in `AsyncGeneratorFunction.any()` and `AsyncGeneratorFunction.race()`
